## User Stories

AAU, I would like to create an account/log into the application before I start using the app so that I can access all the areas of interest.
After registering/logging in, I would like to search a location in the search bar so that I can find areas of interest by location.
After search, I would like to see all the the areas of interest and select them using a show/hide feature so that I can search by category.
Once I see an area of interest, I would like to select or remove this choice from my wishlist using a button so that it clearly indicates what I choose to add or delete.
